# DMF2Mel


DMF2Mel is a state-of-the-art neural network for reconstructing mel spectrograms from non-invasive EEG signals, enabling long-duration imagined speech decoding. This model addresses core challenges in EEG-based speech decoding, such as noise interference, multi-scale feature fragmentation, and long-range temporal dependency modeling, through a dynamic multiscale fusion architecture.
